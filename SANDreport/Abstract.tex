In this report a modified Gurson modeled is presented. It can be used
to model ductile behavior up to and including material failure. The
formulation incorporates the Gurson failure surface, including void
nucleation, growth, and coalescence, with a $J_2$ yield surface
including user-defined hardening behavior. Details of the formulation
and implementation into Sierra/SolidMecahnics are discussed, and some
pertinent aspects and features of the model are illustrated through a
select few numerical examples.
