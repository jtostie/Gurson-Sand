------ TENTATIVE TITLE ------
On the formulation and numerical integration of a shear-modified Gurson model for ductile failure simulation at finite strain

------ OUTLINE ------
1. Introduction

2. Preliminaries for finite deformation hyperelastic formulation

4. Integration of constitutive equations
  4.1 Discrete form of the rate equations
  4.2 Local nonlinear system of equations

5. Numerical implementation and solution procedure
  5.1 Albany analysis code
  5.2 FAD: a numerical exact way of computing consistent tangent

6. Verification - benchmark element tests

7. Ductile failure simulation (maybe a better section title?)
  6.1 Experimental program and results (do we want to include this section?)
