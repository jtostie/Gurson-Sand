In this report a modified Gurson modeled is presented. It can be used
to model ductile behavior up to and including material failure. The
formulation incorporates the Gurson failure surface, including void
nucleation, growth, and coalescence, with a $J_2$ yield surface with
user-defined hardening behavior. Aspects of the formulation and
implementation will be discussed.
