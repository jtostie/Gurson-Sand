\chapter{Implementation}
\label{implementation}

\textit{This section should discuss implementation aspects of the
  large deformation hyperelastic model and the implicit integration
  scheme. I based the Sierra implementation off of the Albany version,
  so that would be a good place to start. In both places we are using
  Sacado to compute derivative for the local consistent tangent, so we
  should talk about what that buys us.}
