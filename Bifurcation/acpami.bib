  Abstract =	 {{This paper presents a three-invariant constitutive
                  framework suitable for the numerical analyses of
                  localization instabilities in granular materials
                  exhibiting unstructured random density. A recently
                  proposed elastoplastic model for sands based on
                  critical state plasticity is enhanced with the third
                  stress invariant to capture the difference in the
                  compressive and extensional yield strengths commonly
                  observed in geomaterials undergoing plastic
                  deformation. The new three-invariant constitutive
                  model, similar to its two-invariant predecessor, is
                  capable of accounting for meso-scale inhomogeneities
                  as well as material and geometric
                  nonlinearities. Details regarding the numerical
                  implementation of the model into a fully nonlinear
                  finite element framework are presented and a
                  closed-form expression for the consistent tangent
                  operator, whose spectral form is used in the strain
                  localization analyses, is derived. An algorithm
                  based on the spectral form of the so-called acoustic
                  tensor is proposed to search for the necessary
                  conditions for deformation bands to develop. The
                  aforementioned framework is utilized in a series of
                  boundary-value problems on dense sand specimens
                  whose density fields are modelled as exponentially
                  distributed unstructured random fields to account
                  for the effect of inhomogeneities at the meso-scale
                  and the intrinsic uncertainty associated with
                  them. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

  Abstract =	 {{Analogously to the classical return-mapping
                  algorithm, so-called variational constitutive
                  updates are numerical methods allowing to compute
                  the unknown state variables such as the plastic
                  strains and the stresses for material models showing
                  an irreversible mechanical response. In sharp
                  contrast to standard approaches in computational
                  inelasticity, the state variables follow naturally
                  and jointly from energy minimization in case of
                  variational constitutive updates. This leads to
                  significant advantages from a numerical,
                  mathematical as well as from a physical point of
                  view. However, while the classical return-mapping
                  algorithm has been being developed for several
                  decades, and thus, it has already reached a certain
                  maturity, variational constitutive updates have
                  drawn attention only relatively recently. This is
                  particularly manifested in the numerical performance
                  of such algorithms. Within the present paper, the
                  numerical efficiency of variational constitutive
                  updates is critically analyzed. It will be shown
                  that a naive approximation of the flow rule causes a
                  singular Hessian within the respective NewtonRaphson
                  scheme. However, by developing a novel
                  parameterization of the flow rule, an efficient
                  algorithm is derived. Its performance is carefully
                  compared to that of the classical return-mapping
                  scheme. This comparison clearly shows that the novel
                  variationally consistent implementation is, at
                  least, as efficient as the classical return-mapping
                  algorithm. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons,

                  of strain localization are based on the requirement

                  closed form to examine the localization properties

                  laboratory loading conditions involves a variety of
                  micromechanical processes producing several
                  geometrically, kinematically, and texturally
                  distinct types of structures. This paper provides a
                  geological framework for failure processes as well
                  as a mathematical model to analyze these
                  processes. Of particular interest is the formation
                  of tabular deformation bands in granular rocks,
                  which could exhibit distinct localized deformation
                  features including simple shearing, pure
                  compaction/dilation, and various possible
                  combinations thereof. The analysis is carried out
                  using classical bifurcation theory combined with
                  non-linear continuum mechanics and
                  theoretical/computational plasticity. For granular
                  media, yielding and plastic flow are known to be
                  influenced by all three stress invariants, and thus
                  we formulate a family of three-invariant plasticity
                  models with a compression cap to capture the entire
                  spectrum of yielding of geomaterials. We then
                  utilize a return mapping algorithm in principal
                  stress directions to integrate the stresses over
                  discrete load increments, allowing the solution to
                  find the critical bifurcation point for a given
                  loading path. The formulation covers both the
                  infinitesimal and finite deformation regimes, and
                  comparisons are made of the localization criteria in
                  the two regimes. In the accompanying paper, we
                  demonstrate with numerical examples the role that
                  the constitutive model and finite deformation
                  effects play on the prediction of the onset of

  Abstract =	 {{Development of accurate mathematical models of
                  geomaterial behavior requires a more fundamental
                  understanding of the localization phenomena; in
                  particular, the important factors responsible for
                  the inception and development of localized
                  deformation. The objective of this paper is to
                  implement and test the mathematical formulations
                  presented in a companion paper to better understand
                  the different failure processes in granular media,
                  specifically the formation of deformation bands in
                  geomaterials. Our approach revolves around the use
                  of classical bifurcation theory combined with
                  advanced constitutive modeling and state-of-the-art
                  computation to capture the end members of the
                  failures modes described in the companion paper,
                  namely, simple shear, pure compaction, and pure
                  dilation bands, as well as the combination modes
                  described in the geological framework. The paper
                  revisits the notion of the critical hardening
                  modulus as it applies to the entire range of failure
                  modes, elucidates the role of the third stress
                  invariant and finite deformation effects on the
                  localization properties, and describes some useful
                  properties of the constitutive and algorithmic
                  tangent operators as they relate to the capture of
                  the onset of deformation bands in geomaterials. (C)

  Abstract =	 {{The purpose of this article is to present a general
                  framework for constitutive viscoelastic models in
                  finite strain regime. The approach is qualified as
                  variational since the constitutive updates obey a
                  minimum principle within each load increment. The
                  set of internal variables is strain-based and
                  employs, according to the specific model chosen, a
                  multiplicative decomposition of strain into elastic
                  and viscous components. The present approach shares
                  the same technical procedures used for analogous
                  models of plasticity or viscoplasticity, such as the
                  Solution of a minimization problem to identify
                  inelastic updates and the use of exponential mapping
                  for time integration.  However. instead of using the
                  classical decomposition of inelastic strains into
                  amplitude and direction, we take advantage of a
                  spectral decomposition that provides additional
                  facilities to accommodate, into simple analytical
                  expressions, a wide set of specific
                  models. Moreover, appropriate choices of the
                  constitutive potentials allow the reproduction of
                  other formulations in the literature. The final part
                  of the paper presents a set of numerical examples in
                  order to explore the characteristics of the
                  formulation as well as its applicability to usual

                  concepts and tools needed for solving problems of a
                  geometric nature using a computer. It attempts to
                  fill the gap between standard geometry books, which
                  are primarily theoretical, and applied books on
                  computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, or
                  machine learning. This book covers the following
                  topics: affine geometry, projective geometry,
                  Euclidean geometry, convex sets, {SVD} and principal
                  component analysis, manifolds and Lie groups,
                  quadratic optimization, basics of differential
                  geometry, and a glimpse of computational geometry
                  {(Voronoi} diagrams and Delaunay
                  triangulations). Some practical applications of the
                  concepts presented in this book include computer
                  vision, more specifically contour grouping, motion
                  interpolation, and robot kinematics. In this
                  extensively updated second edition, more material on
                  convex sets, Farkas "s lemma, quadratic optimization
                  and the Schur complement have been added. The
                  chapter on {SVD} has been greatly expanded and now
                  includes a presentation of {PCA.} The book is well
                  illustrated and has chapter summaries and a large
                  number of exercises throughout. It will be of
                  interest to a wide audience including computer
                  scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. Reviews
                  of first {edition:"Gallier's} book will be a useful
                  source for anyone interested in applications of
                  geometrical methods to solve problems that arise in
                  various branches of engineering. It may help to
                  develop the sophisticated concepts from the more

                  treatment of material instabilities and localization
                  phenomena based on energy minimization principles in
                  a strain-softening elastic-plastic bar. The basis is
                  a recently developed incremental variational
                  formulation of the local constitutive response for
                  generalized standard media. It provides a
                  quasi-hyperelastic stress potential that is obtained
                  from a local minimization of the incremental energy
                  density with respect to the internal variables. The
                  existence of this variational formulation induces
                  the definition of the material stability of
                  inelastic solids based on convexity properties in
                  analogy to treatments in elasticity.  Furthermore,
                  localization phenomena are understood as
                  micro-structure development associated with a
                  non-convex incremental stress potential in analogy
                  to phase decomposition problems in elasticity. For
                  the one-dimensional bar considered the two-phase
                  micro-structure can analytically be resolved by the
                  construction of a sequentially weakly lower
                  semicontinuous energy functional that envelops the
                  not well-posed original problem. This relaxation
                  procedure requires the solution of a local energy
                  minimization problem with two variables which define
                  the one-dimensional micro-structure developing: the
                  volume fraction and the intensity of the
                  micro-bifurcation. The relaxation analysis yields a
                  well-posed boundary-value problem for an objective
                  post-critical localization analysis. The performance
                  of the proposed method is demon-strated for
                  different discretizations of the elastic-plastic bar
                  which document on the mesh-independence of the

                  based on energy minimization principles associated
                  with microstructure developments. The point of
                  departure is a general internal variable formulation
                  that determines the finite inelastic response as a
                  standard dissipative medium. Consistent with this
                  type of inelasticity we consider an incremental
                  variational formulation of the local constitutive
                  response where a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential
                  is obtained from a local constitutive minimization
                  problem with respect to the internal variables. The
                  existence of this variational formulation allows the
                  definition of the material stability of an inelastic
                  solid based on weak convexity conditions of the
                  incremental stress potential in analogy to
                  treatments of finite elasticity. Furthermore,
                  localization phenomena are interpreted as
                  microstructure developments on multiple scales
                  associated with non-convex incremental stress
                  potentials in analogy to elastic phase decomposition
                  problems. These microstructures can be resolved by
                  the relaxation of non-convex energy functionals
                  based on a convexification of the stress
                  potential. The relaxed problem provides a well-posed

                  localizations as close as possible to the non-convex

                  we develop a computational two-scale procedure for a

                  strains based on energy minimization principles
                  associated with micro-structure developments. The
                  point of departure is a general internal variable
                  formulation that determines the inelastic response
                  as a standard dissipative medium. Consistent with
                  this type of inelasticity we consider an incremental
                  variational formulation of the local constitutive
                  response where a quasihyperelastic stress potential
                  is obtained from a local constitutive minimization
                  problem with respect to the internal variables. The
                  existence of this variational formulation allows the
                  definition of the material stability of an inelastic
                  solid based on weak convexity conditions of the
                  incremental stress potential in analogy to
                  treatments in finite elasticity. Furthermore,
                  localization phenomena are interpreted as
                  micro-structure developments on multiple scales
                  associated with non-convex incremental stress
                  potentials in analogy to elastic phase decomposition
                  problems. These micro-structures can be resolved by
                  the relaxation of non-convex energy functionals
                  based on a convexification of the stress
                  potential. The relaxed problem provides a well-posed

                  two-scale procedure for a mesh-objective treatment

                  internal variable formulation that determines the
                  inelastic response of the constituents of a typical
                  micro-structure as a generalized standard medium in
                  terms of an energy storage and a dissipation
                  function. Consistent with this type of finite
                  inelasticity we develop a new incremental
                  variational formulation of the local constitutive
                  response, where a quasi-hyperelastic micro-stress
                  potential is obtained from a local minimization
                  problem with respect to the internal variables. It
                  is shown that this local minimization problem
                  determines the internal state of the material for
                  finite increments of time. We specify the local
                  variational formulation for a distinct setting of
                  multi-surface inelasticity and develop a numerical
                  solution technique based on a time discretization of
                  the internal variables. The existence of the
                  quasi-hyperelastic stress potential allows the
                  extension of homogenization approaches of finite
                  elasticity to the incremental setting of finite
                  inelasticity. Focussing on macro-deformation-driven
                  micro-structures, we develop a new incremental
                  variational formulation of the global homogenization
                  problem for generalized standard materials at finite
                  strains, where a quasi-hyperelastic macro-stress
                  potential is obtained from a global minimization
                  problem with respect to the fine-scale displacement
                  fluctuation field. It is shown that this global
                  minimization problem determines the state of the
                  micro-structure for finite increments of time. We
                  consider three different settings of the global
                  variational problem for prescribed displacements,
                  non-trivial periodic displacements and prescribed

                  develop numerical solution methods based on a
                  spatial discretization of the fine-scale
                  displacement fluctuation field.  Representative
                  applications of the proposed minimization principles

                  rate-independent standard dissipative solids at
                  finite strains based on finite-step-sized
                  incremental energy minimization principles. The
                  point of departure is a recently developed
                  constitutive minimization principle for standard
                  dissipative materials that optimizes a generalized
                  incremental work function with respect to the
                  internal variables. In an incremental setting at
                  finite time steps this variational problem defines a
                  quasi-hyperelastic stress potential. The existence
                  of this potential allows to be recast a typical
                  incremental boundary-value problem of quasi-static
                  inelasticity into a principle of minimum incremental
                  energy for standard dissipative solids. Mathematical
                  existence theorems for sufficiently regular
                  minimizers then induce a definition of the material
                  stability of the inelastic material response in
                  terms of the sequentially weakly lower
                  semicontinuity of the incremental variational
                  functional. As a consequence, the incremental
                  material stability of standard dissipative solids
                  may be defined in terms of the quasi-convexity or
                  the rank-one convexity of the incremental stress
                  potential. This global definition includes the
                  classical local Hadamard condition but is more
                  general. Furthermore, the variational setting opens
                  up the possibility to analyze the post-critical
                  development of deformation microstructures in
                  non-stable inelastic materials based on energy
                  relaxation methods. We outline minimization
                  principles of quasi- and rank-one convexifications
                  of incremental non-convex stress potentials for
                  standard dissipative solids. The general concepts
                  are applied to the analysis of evolving deformation
                  microstructures in single-slip plasticity. For this
                  canonical model problem, we outline details of the
                  constitutive variational formulation and develop
                  numerical and semi-analytical solution methods for a
                  first-level rank-one convexification. A set of
                  representative numerical investigations analyze the
                  development of deformation microstructures in the
                  form of rank-one laminates in single slip plasticity

                  rate-independent dissipative solids at finite

                  plasticity theory based on a multiplicative
                  decomposition of the deformation gradient. Adopting
                  the formalism of standard dissipative solids which
                  allows to describe constitutive models by means of
                  only two potentials being the Helmholtz energy and
                  the yield function (or equivalently, a dissipation
                  functional), finite strain plasticity is recast into
                  an equivalent minimization problem. In contrast to
                  previous models, the presented framework covers
                  isotropic and kinematic hardening as well as
                  isotropic and anisotropic elasticity and yield

                  classical approaches such as the return-mapping
                  algorithm and analogously to the theoretical part,
                  the numerical formulation is variationally

                  naturally from minimizing the energy of the

                  numerically efficient and robust optimization
                  schemes can be directly employed for solving the
                  resulting minimization problem. Extending previously
                  published works on variational constitutive updates,
                  the advocated model does not rely on any material
                  symmetry and therefore, it can be applied to a broad
                  range of different plasticity theories. As two
                  examples, an anisotropic Hill-type and a Barlat-type
                  model are implemented. Numerical examples
                  demonstrate the applicability and the performance of
                  the proposed implementation. (C) 2009 Elsevier

  Abstract =	 {{The paper discusses the consequences of the
                  incremental nonlinearity of a constitutive model of
                  a solid for the analyses of characteristic wave
                  speeds, acceleration waves, the second-order work
                  criterion and shear band formation. Incremental
                  nonlinearity may entail qualitative changes in the
                  results as compared to incrementally linear
                  models. Certain well-known correlations cannot be
                  established if the constitutive equation is assumed
                  to be incrementally nonlinear. In particular, the
                  spectra of the characteristic wave speeds and the
                  acceleration wave speeds become continuous and are
                  described by different equations. The second-order
                  work criterion as a sufficient condition of
                  uniqueness of the incremental boundary value problem
                  loses its applicability in bifurcation analyses,
                  unless the applicability can be proved for a
                  particular type of nonlinearity. The singularity of
                  the acoustic tensor in the general nonlinear case
                  correlates neither with the vanishing of the
                  second-order work nor with the shear band
                  formation.}},
