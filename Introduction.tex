The purpose of this work is to present a modified Gurson constitutive
model for use in capturing the behavior of ductile materials in the
failure regime. The Gurson model has been used extensively in metal
plasticity, starting with \cite{Gurson1977}, and the modified Gurson
model described here was recently proposed by \cite{Nahshon2008}, and
extended to include void nucleation in \cite{Nahshon2009}. In this
treatment with incorporate a hyperelastic strain energy potential to
define the underlying model of elasticity, and investigate a fully
implicit Newton algorithm for integration of the evolution equations
associated with the state variables used to define the constitutive
response.
