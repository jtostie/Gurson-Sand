% This is an example of how to create the distribution page. Some
% distributions are required by Sandia; e.g. the housekeeping copies.
% Depending on the type of report; e.g. CRADA, Patent Caution, etc.
% additional distribution lines may have to be added. See the
% "Guide for Preparing SAND Reports"
%
% SANDdistribution takes CA or NM as an optional argument. If given,
% the approrpiate housekeeping copies are inserted autmatically.
% Inside the SANDdistribution environment, several commands can be used
% insert the distributions for CRADA, LDRD, etc. See example below.
%
% You can leave the CA or NM option off and not use any of the SANDdist*
% commands. This will allow you to create a distribution list manually.
%
\begin{SANDdistribution}[CA]
    % Housekeeping copies necessary for every unclassified report:
    % \SANDdistCRADA	% If this report is about CRADA work
    % \SANDdistPatent	% If this report has a Patent Caution or Patent Interest
    % \SANDdistLDRD	% If this report is about LDRD work

    % Some external Addresses
    \SANDdistExternal{1}{Qiushi Chen\\ Clemson University, Lowry Hall 109\\Clemson, SC 29634}
    \bigskip


    % The following MUST BE between the external and internal distributions!
    % \SANDdistClassified % If this report is classified


    % Internal Addresses
    \SANDdistInternal{1}{9042}{Jake Ostien}{8256}
    \SANDdistInternal{1}{9042}{James W. Foulk III}{8256}
    \SANDdistInternal{1}{????}{Kendall Pierson}{1542}

    % Example of a mail channel use (instead of a mail stop)
